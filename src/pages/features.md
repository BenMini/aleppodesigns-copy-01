      Hi, 


      I'm Ben i'm a novice web developer. I want to help you get up and running
      with a website. 


      Here are the services I offer:


      * Helping with Domain Registration

      * Setting up DNS servers

      * Setting up Hosting

      * Helping you develop content for your site

      * SEO

      * Full Stack Development


      If this all sounds alien to you, no worries. I'll hold your hand through
      the whole process. 


      We'll start by you showing me what you want to see in a website, then
      we'll build it out step by step.


      Once up and running, i'll walk you through maintaining and updating
      components.


      I also offer a subscription service once your site is built out. Where if
      anything goes wrong, I'll jump in and diagnose and fix the problem.
